   The C++ was chosen as the coding language as it is a standard of quantitative finance (see \cite duffy3 \cite london \cite capinski) It is also robust, fast, with large numbers of open source projects providing efficient numerical routines.

   \section cpp_comp Compiler

    We use g++ from GNU Compiler Collection version 6.4. We compile our code with following flags:<br> 
    * \b std=c++17 \b pedantic to ensure the compliance with other compilers,
    * \b Wall and \b  Wextra simply because it is a good practice;
    * \b 03 No issues with optimization found.

    1. General
    ==========

    Any violation to the guide is allowed if it enhances readability.

    2. Files
    ========
    
    C++ header files should have extension *.hpp. Source files must have the extension  *.cpp.

    A class should be declared in a header file and defined in a source file where the name of the files should match the name of the class.

    Header files must contain an include guard in a form JULIAN_(FILENAME)_HPP.

    Include statements must be located at the top of a file only.

    3. Classes, structures and enumerations
    =======================================

    Names representing types must be in upper case notation (e.g. InterestRate, VolatilitySurface). Prefer to capitalize acronyms as single words (e.g. GslFunctionWrapper).

    Name of class members should be named as ordinary variables, but with a trailing underscore.

    Names representing methods should be verbs. Names of the methods must be written in lower case notation.

    Use structures only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a class.

    Enumeration types should be named in upper-case notation. Individual enumerations should be named all upper-case.

    4. Variables
    =====================

     Variable names must be in underscore notation (e.g. discounting_curve, pln_calendar etc.)

     Variables with a large scope should have long names, variables with a small scope can have short names.
