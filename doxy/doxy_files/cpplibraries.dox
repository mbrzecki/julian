    <b>Licence:</b>  OOQP is copyrighted to the University of Chicago.<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp/COPYRIGHT.html">Read more here.</a>

    OOQP is an object-oriented C++ package, based on a primal-dual interior-point method, for solving convex quadratic programming problems (QPs). It contains code that can be used "out of the box" to solve a variety of structured QPs, including general sparse QPs, QPs arising from support vector machines, Huber regression problems, and QPs with bound constraints. OOQP uses fortran library ma27 which is a part of <a href="http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive">Harwell Subroutine Library archive</a>. HSL is a collection of Fortran codes for large scale scientific computation. HSL archive is avaible at no cost for commercial use , <a href="http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/licencing.html"> but software may not be redistributed</a>. 

    <b>Installation:</b><br>
	 	 1. Install ma27 library by typing: <i>./configure && make</i>
		 2. Copy libma27.a from src directory to /OOQP/extras/MA27.
 		 3. Usually config.guess in OOQP <i>config</i> directory is outdated. Replace it with latest config.guess (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/config/).
		 4. Type ./configure.
		 5. Change compiler to g++ in GNUMakefile.
		 6. Type <i>make install</i>

    LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition.

    6. BLAS
    -------

    <b>License:</b> The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package. <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/#_licensing">Read more. </a>
    
    The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality linear algebra software, like Armadillo, LAPACK, GNU Octave, Mathematica, MATLAB, NumPy and R.
