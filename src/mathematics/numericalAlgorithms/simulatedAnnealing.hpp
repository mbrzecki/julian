   * \brief Class implements Simulated Annealing minimizer
   *
   * Simulating annealing is a stochastic algorithm used to solve optimization problems.
   * 
   * Quoting authors of \b Numerical \b Recipes (Chapter 10.9 \cite NumRec):
   * 
   * *At the heart of the method of simulated annealing is an analogy with thermodynamics,
   * specifically with the way that liquids freeze and crystallize, or metals cool
   * and anneal. At high temperatures, the molecules of a liquid move freely with respect
   * to one another. If the liquid is cooled slowly, thermal mobility is lost. The atoms are
   * often able to line themselves up and form a pure crystal that is completely ordered
   * over a distance up to billions of times the size of an individual atom in all directions.
   * This crystal is the state of minimum energy for this system.*
   *
   * The pseudo-code of simulated annealing's algorithm is presented below:
   * \verbatim
    x = initial guess
    x_best = x
    E = f(x)
    E_best = E
    for temperature in cooling_schedule:
        iter = 0
        while iter < maximum number of steps:
           x_new = pick a neighbour of x
           E_new = f(x_new) 
   
           if E_new <= E_best:
               x_best = x_new
               E_best = E_new
           
	       if E_new < E:
               x = x_new
               E = E_new
           else if ( U(0,1) < acceptance_probability(E, E_new, T)
               x = x_new
               E = E_new
            
	   iter++
    \endverbatim 
   * 
   * Cooling schedule is a series of decreasing real numbers. The *temperature* influences the acceptance probability. For more details see \cite coolingschemes
   *
   * The neighbour is picked from distribution provided by user. The distribution expected value should be equal to zero. Usually it is a normal or uniform distribution.
   *
   * Acceptance probability is the probability of moving to a new state. If new steps is a step of lower energy the probability of taking the step is 1.0.
   * In other case the probability is calculated using the acceptance probability function and compared to randomly picked number from standard uniform distribution.
   * It means that algorithm can choose the non-optimal state, what makes the algorithm immune to local minimums. 
   * Larger increases in energy of the system should be less probably. The probability of such steps should decrease with temperature of the system.  
   * Kirkpatrick et al. choose the Boltzmann distribution: \f$p = e^{-(E_{new} - E)/(kT)}\f$ , justified by analogy with the transitions of a physical systems.
   * It also corresponds to the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm (see \cite hastings). The implemented algorithm enables usage of any acceptance probability.
